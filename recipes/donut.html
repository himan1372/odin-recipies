        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Pour the milk, melted Butter,egg,and yeast into a bowl.Stir it all together then let it sit for around 10 minutes so the yeast can foam.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>in a mixer bowl, add the flour,sugar and salt then combine. yo can do this by hand but it will take 10-15 minutes of kneading.</p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Start the mixer with dry ingredients on low, then you <em>slowly</em> add in foamed yeast-milk mix.Once it is <strong>all in</strong> turn it up to high and mix for about 3 minutes.The dough should be sticky and soft.(if its too sticky to remove from the bowl add 1 tablespoon of flor and mix for another minute)</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>After 3 minutes. tip your dough out onto a floured surface to finish by hand.</p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>knead the dough <em>a little</em> by hand, unitl it is smooth and can be rolled into a nice ball</p>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Grease a large bowl with oil or cooking spray.Form a smooth ball with the dough and put it in th bowl.cover with plastic wrap and lt it proof on the counter for around two hours. make ure to keep it in a warm area, but not in direct sunlight.It should rise and triple in size about</p>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>After about two hours place the dough back onto the floured surface.It will deflate alot so dont worry its supposed to happen</p>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <p>roll the dough with a rolling pin to about a thicnss of 1 in.Use a round cookie cutter to cut the dough and place them on a baking sheet with parchment paper</p>
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <p><strong>Loosely</strong> cover the tray with some plastic wrap or a <em>clean</em> tea towel. let it proof for another 45 minute period</p>
            <h3>Step 10</h3>
            <p>In the last 10 minutes of the 45-minute proof, start preparing the frying oil.Pout at least 2 inches of oil into a deep sauce pan and heat it to around 350f/180c.Try to keep the oil temps steady.If you don`t have thermometer use a wooden sppon dip it into the oil and you will know the temps are right if it starts to fizz lightly.If its fizzing alot it is too hot cool it down</p>
            <h3>Step 11</h3>
            <p><em>Gently</em> place your donuts into the oil they should start bubbling at the sides. it is best if you only do a few at a time depending on the size of your saucepan.They fry really fast so you want to have as much control as You can</p>
            <h3>Step 12</h3>
            <p>Allow the donuts to fry for 1-2 minutes. Make sure to keep an eye on the underside!Once the underside turns golden brown,flip the donut and fry the other side to match the color.Just make sure the donuts look ready to you because having so many varieables makes it hard to measure exactly the right times to fry them</p>
            <h3>Step 13</h3>
            <p>Once both sides are a golden brown, scoop the donuts out with a slotted spoon or tongs (make sure they are heat resistant and please <strong>Be Careful</strong>) lay them on a wire rack lined with paper towels to soak the extra oil</p>
            <h3>Step 14</h3>
            <p>After they have cooled for a minute or two they should look dry, but they should still be hot.Roll in a bowl of sugar then let them cool</p>
            <h3>Step 15</h3>
            <p>Once they are cooled off, use a thin long object like a sturdy or metal straw to poke a hole inside move it around a little to create extra room for the best part the custard and you want them to be FULL!</p>
            <h3>Step 16</h3>
            <p>Put your custard in a piping bag with any nozzle youd like!then push the nozzle into the hole you created earlier and squeeze gently.You should start to fell the donut getting heavier which is intended.<em>slowly</em> pull the nozzle out.</p>
            <h3>Step 17ish</h3>
            <p>Fill all of your beautiful donuts with some delicious custard</p>
